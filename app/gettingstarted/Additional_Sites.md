#Adding Sites

If you wish to track multiple sites, Jirafe allows you to add additional sites to your account.  The analytics for each of the sites will be tracked separately.

1. Log in to Jirafe
2. Click your site's name in the top right corner, and choose 'Add a Site'.

	 ![Add Site]({{site-baseurl}}/img/pages/Add_Site.png)
	 
3. Follow the steps in Jirafe to create your new site: 

* Choose your platform
* Choose a plan
* Name your site  
	
The last page will have your site credentials on it.  You will need to add these credentials to your respective platform in order to connect the additional site to the Jirafe platform.
