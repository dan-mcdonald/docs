# Installing Jirafe on Your eCommerce Platform

We aim to make installing Jirafe for your ecommerce store easy.  So we are either writing our own certified extensions for leading commerce platforms or working with partner platforms to do so.  All with the goal so that you can get Jirafe running out-of-the-box with as little development as possible.

If you are running one of the platforms below, we already have an extension for you!  Just [sign up](https://account.jirafe.com/accounts/register/ '') for Jirafe, download and install.  For more information on platforms currently available out-of-the-box, check out the one that is right for you.

* [Jirafe for hybris]( Installing_Jirafe_for_hybris '')
* [Jirafe for Magento](Installing_Jirafe_for_Magento '')

If you don't see your platform listed, rest assured, you still have options.  We and our platform partners are adding new extensions every month so be sure to [sign up](https://account.jirafe.com/accounts/register/ '') and get our waiting list.  We'll notify you as soon as your platfrom is available.

And of course, if you want to get started immediately or if you have a custom commerce solution, check out our [API Documentation](/api/v2/api_overview 'API Documentation') for more information on how to integrate Jirafe and build your own app.  

We are always interested to hear what you are trying to do and the app you are building, and we are here to help.  So always feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@jirafe.com "Jirafe Support")!
